            />HTML, or <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>, is the language used to
            describe the structure of content on the web. As with other markup
            languages, it uses tags to identify page elements and describe the
            page&rsquo;s semantic structure. An easy way to visualize this is to
            consider the various types of documents you see on a day-to-day
            basis, like magazine and newspaper articles or documents created in
            a program like Microsoft Word. The formatting of those documents
            ensures that the information is presented clearly, with a distinct
            hierarchy. This allows readers to quickly scan the page and
            determine which information is important and how the content relates
            to each other. HTML allows us to do that for web pages by first
            establishing the overall document structure, and then formatting
            elements like headings and paragraphs.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            HTML can trace its roots back to 1989 at <b>CERN</b>, the European
            Laboratory for Particle Physics. There, Tim Berners-Lee came up with
            the idea of having scientists from around the world collaborate on
            research. His idea was rather than simply making documents available
            on a server as many people were doing at the time, the documents
            themselves should be able to link to one another, in a way that
            would enhance collaboration and make information easier to find and
            more accessible. From this idea Tim created HTML (based off SGML, an
            earlier markup language) to format pages and HTTP (or Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol) to transfer them from one computer to another.
            Although the world didn&rsquo;t quite realize it yet, the World Wide
            Web was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the popularity of the web increased in the early 90s, HTML
            underwent a series of rapid changes. Browser manufacturers like
            Netscape and Microsoft started to develop their own proprietary
            tags, and development bodies like the IETF (the Internet Engineering
            Task Force) and the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) were finding
            it difficult to gain traction with the standardization process of
            HTML. By 1995, the W3C created an editorial review board for HTML
            that included members of the W3C as well as representatives from
            browser developers and other organizations. This collaborative board
            had a major impact in stabilizing the HTML standard and reducing the
            uneven implementations that had plagued earlier browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This resulted in the HTML 4.0 specification being released in 1998.
            It was the most stable version of HTML up to that point, and
            formalized many of the improvements made to HTML over the years.
            It&rsquo;s still the most widely used version of HTML and remains
            the baseline for authors and implementers alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the time that HTML 4.0 was published, a movement began to
            evolve HTML towards a more flexible style of markup language.
            Although authors had tried to anticipate the tags necessary to
            markup documents, the spread of the World Wide Web and the diversity
            of user agents made keeping up with requirements difficult. In the
            eyes of many, migrating to a markup language like XML, which allows
            authors to create their own tags to represent content, would
            alleviate those concerns and allow HTML to evolve organically. XML
            also contains stricter formatting rules than HTML, and a sizable
            number of authors and developers found HTML&rsquo;s lax parsing
            rules problematic. This effort resulted in the publishing of the
            XHTML 1.0 specification in 2000.
