            Because HTML is often the people&rsquo;s first experience with
            coding, there can be a fair amount of apprehension about learning
            it. Thankfully, HTML syntax is relatively simple and easy to learn.
            Most people can learn the basics of HTML and begin coding it within
            the same day.

          <h3>A markup language</h3>
          <p>
            HTML is a markup language. That means that content on the page is
            &ldquo;marked up&rdquo; by tags which identify the content inside of
            them. A paragraph, for example, can be identified by placing the
            &ldquo;&lt;p&gt;&rdquo; opening tag prior to the paragraphs content
            and the &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&rdquo; closing tag at the end of a
            paragraph. The full paragraph would look like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>
            Tags consist of a left-angle bracket (&lt;) followed by a character
            or characters that identify the tag (the &ldquo;p&rdquo; for
            paragraph) and a closing right-angle bracket (&gt;). The closing
            tags for an element are exactly the same as an opening tag, except
            that a forward slash (/) will precede the tags characters.<br />
            Although most elements require an opening and a closing tag, the
            closing tag is optional for some elements and not required at all
            for others. While there are exceptions to the rule, for the most
            part any element that contains content inside the opening and
            closing tags also requires a closing tag.

          <h3>Basic document structure</h3>
          <p>
            The core of all HTML documents revolves around three basic tags.
            First, an html tag (&lt;html&gt;) is required to identify the
            document as an HTML file. Directly inside the html tag, you&rsquo;ll
            find the head element (&lt;head&gt;). The head of a document is
            where you&rsquo;ll find the document&rsquo;s metadata, the document
            title, and links to external resources such as style sheets and
            scripts. A good way to think about the document&rsquo;s head is that
            it doesn&rsquo;t contain any of the page&rsquo;s
            <em>visual</em> content rather it contains information about the
            document and the resources that help make the page work. Directly
            after the document&rsquo;s head, you&rsquo;ll find its body
            (&lt;body&gt;). The body is where you&rsquo;ll find all of the
            page&rsquo;s actual content. Headings, paragraphs, images, lists,
            tables, and other content will be located here. At its most basic,
            an HTML file would look like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;     
     &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

          <h3>DOCTYPES</h3>
          <p>
            If you&rsquo;ve looked at HTML pages before, you&rsquo;ve probably
            noticed a long, somewhat intimidating tag just before the opening
            HTML tag. This is a doctype declaration and it&rsquo;s a very
            important but often misunderstood component of HTML pages.
            Essentially, it tells the user agent parsing your page which version
            of HTML (or XHTML) to expect, so that it knows which syntax rules to
            use when rendering your page. The doctype you use should be based on
            the version of HTML you&rsquo;re using to author the page. While
            that all sounds good in theory, in reality most of the time a
            doctype is simply triggering &ldquo;standards-mode&rdquo; rather
            than &ldquo;quirks mode&rdquo; (based on older browsers non-standard
            way of rendering pages). For that reason alone, all HTML documents
            should be preceded by a doctype declaration. For more information on
            doctypes, and the history behind them, check out Mark
            Pilgrim&rsquo;s excellent section on doctypes from his
            <em

          <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
          <h4 class="dtd">XHTML 1.0 Transitional</h4>
          <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
          <h4 class="dtd">HTML5</h4>

          <h3>Element attributes</h3>
          <p>
            Some elements can be enhanced through the use of attributes.
            Attributes allow you to provide more information or additional
            functionality to the content. Attributes are added to the opening
            tag of an element and consist of two parts, the
            <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong>. Although the
            syntax varies based on the version of HTML you&rsquo;re using,
            it&rsquo;s standard practice to put values within quotation marks.
          </p>

          <h3>Replaced elements</h3>
          <p>
            Some HTML elements represent content that is replaced by an outside
            resource such as an image, form control, or a video file. These
            elements are referred to as <strong>replaced elements</strong> and
            usually have a predetermined width or height. In some cases the
            elements will have attributes that tell the browser where to find an
            external resource like an image or video.
          </p>

          <h3>Code structure</h3>
          <p>
            HTML documents create structure by nesting elements inside of one
            another.

            Often it is helpful to leave notes to yourself or other developers
            within your code.
